I am a doctoral student at [Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) interested in secure and safe machine learning. I am co-adviced by [Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html) and [Goran Radanovic](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gradanovic/index.html).

## <span style="color:800000">Projects</span> 
- **[Inpaiting Detection](https://github.com/HLCV-23/Inpainting-Detection)**  
Combine automatic segmentation with inpainting to automatically create edited images.
Additionally experimented with detecting these faked images.
- **Safe Streets**  
Extend pedestrian route recommendation by taking into account the safety of the route
(e.g. lights, open shops).
- **Interview Performance Prediction and Lie Detection**  
Implementation of model that evaluated the performance and detected lies of
a participant of mock-job interviews.
